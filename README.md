## Goal

This is a repository for working on algorithm and very simple AI based algorithm.

## Overview

The goal of this repo is to create an algorithm that can connect to online games of words where a set of letters are being offered for the user to generate words.

The user gains points based on the complexity and length of the word.

As such the algorithm should learn and improve the solution it picks.
Finally the algorithm should be able to remove words that the game does not reference as well as adding words that the game know but the initial dictionary does not.
